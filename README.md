# Heart Disease Classification Using a K-Nearest Neighbors Classification Algorithm
Authors: Andy Hu, Sharon Tu, Dylan Zhang, Renz Tingson

### Abstract
We use the Cleveland heart disease dataset, containing 14 distinct characteristics about each patient and the condition of their heart disease, to research how well we can classify if a patient has a heart disease based on factors that can be more easily monitored at home, including age and maximum heart rate achieved. For the purposes of our research, presence of heart disease in a patient is indicated by greater than 50% narrowing of blood vessels. To do so, we train a model using a K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm by first tuning for an optimal value of `k` through cross-validation, and follow up by creating an optimal model using the best value for the number of neighbors to use. Then, we use our model to predict a patient's condition, and determine whether or not our model can be used as a mainstream way of testing for whether an individual has a heart disease, signalling the need to visit the doctor or seek further medical attention.
